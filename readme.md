# Rust Signal Encoder

This is a Rust program that allows users to encode a sequence of zeros and ones using various encoding methods, and display the resulting encoded signal in either vertical or horizontal form.

## Installation

To run this program, you must have Rust installed on your system. You can download Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once you have Rust installed, clone or download this repository onto your system.

To clone:

    git clone https://github.com/bcmaia/rusty_wave

## Usage

To use the program, navigate to the directory where the program is located and run the following command in your terminal:

    cargo run --release

It might take a while to compile :p

The program will prompt you for several input values to determine the encoding method and display format of the encoded signal. Once these values have been entered, you will be prompted to enter a sequence of zeros and ones.

The program will then encode the input sequence and display the resulting signal in the specified format. You can move the displayed signal left or right by entering 3 or 4 at the menu prompt.
